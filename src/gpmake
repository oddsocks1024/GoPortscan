; Build Script for Go Portscan.

; Unless you really know what you're doing, use this script to rebuild
; Go Portscan as it takes care of build order and helps prevent compiling
; with stale modules.

; cached locales from memory which are no longer open. Otherwise you risk Go
; Portscan! opening the cached version instead of the version which you may have
; made changes to.
